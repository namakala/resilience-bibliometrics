# Getting started

Most of the works in this repository, especially the `R` scripts, should
be directly reproducible. You’ll need
[`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads),
[`R`](https://www.r-project.org/),
[`quarto`](https://quarto.org/docs/download/), and more conveniently
[RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/downloads/) installed and running well in
your system. You simply need to fork/clone this repository using RStudio
by following [this tutorial, start right away from
`Step 2`](https://book.cds101.com/using-rstudio-server-to-clone-a-github-repo-as-a-new-project.html#step---2).
Using terminal in linux/MacOS, you can issue the following command:

    quarto tools install tinytex

This command will install `tinytex` in your path, which is required to
compile quarto documents as latex/pdf. Afterwards, in your RStudio
command line, you can copy paste the following code to setup your
working directory:

    install.packages("renv") # Only need to run this step if `renv` is not installed

This step will install `renv` package, which will help you set up the
`R` environment. Please note that `renv` helps tracking, versioning, and
updating packages I used throughout the analysis.

    renv::restore()

This step will read `renv.lock` file and install required packages to
your local machine. When all packages loaded properly (make sure there’s
no error at all), you *have to* restart your R session. Then, you should
be able to proceed with:

    targets::tar_make()

This step will read `_targets.R` file, where I systematically draft all
of the analysis steps. Once it’s done running, you will find the
rendered document (either in `html` or `pdf`) inside the `draft`
directory.

# What’s this all about?

This is the analysis pipeline for conducting analysis in an umbrella
review. The complete flow can be viewed in the following `mermaid`
